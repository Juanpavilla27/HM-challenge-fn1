# C++ Challenge Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a challenge where you will implement several functions that deal with bitwise operations, random number generation, key generation, and simple encryption-like processes.

## Instructions

To participate in the challenge, follow the steps below:

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, you need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

### 2. Clone the Developer Branch
Clone the developer branch of this repository to your local machine:

`git clone --branch developer https://github.com/Operaciones-Digitales-Encriptadas/HM-challenge-fn1`

### 3. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for your solution. The branch name must follow this convention:
feature/the-name-of-your-implementation

For example:

`git checkout -b feature/bitlength-implementation`

### 3. Implement the Exercise

"Navigate to the `challenges/fn1` directory to begin the challenge."

Inside the fn1 folder, you will find:

- A README.md file with specific instructions for the exercise.
- A src folder where you will add your implementation.
- A main.cpp file inside the src folder that you will modify.

You need to enter the fn1 folder and follow the instructions inside its README.md to complete the exercise.

The exercise consists of implementing the following functions in C++:

### 4. Submission
Once you have implemented the functions:
- Push your branch to the remote repository:
`git push origin feature/the-name-of-your-implementation`

- Open a pull request for review.

### Good luck with the challenge!
